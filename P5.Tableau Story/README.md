# Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree- Tableau Story

This folder contains the files for the P5. Tableau Story project

Goal of Project: Salt Lake City is located between two mountain ranges, the Oquirrh Mountains to the west and the Wasatch Mountains to the east. During the winter and summer seasons, the Salt Lake Valley is subject to metrological inversions, where colder air is trapped under a “lid” of warmer air. These inversions trap air pollutants within the valley, causing major health issues in the population. This analysis utilizes air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency to discover Salt Lake City air quality trends from 1980 to present.
